/*
NOTES:
Part 1:
For this one, since the input file consisted of essentially two parts, I realized that it would be much more of a pain 
than I wanted to parse the whole file straight up. I manually entered the starting stacks.

I just used the same steps I previously used to parse the actual instructions into multiple lines. Then I just used a REPLACE
to get rid of the text I didn't care about. Then used the awesome PARSENAME to get the pieces into columns in the rows, so that
I could work with them. 

It took me a while to figure out how to use my WHILE loops to get the stacks working properly, but once I thought it through, 
the steps were easier than I thought they'd be. 

The toughest part was keeping track of which thing moved when.


Part 2:
Part 2 through the curveball of moving multiple crates at a time. This wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. I forgot to initialize 
one of my variables for an empty column, and when I fixed that with an ISNULL, things started moving like they were supposed to.

After I got home and tried this with a different input, I was getting a wrong answer. I reran the inputs that I originally ran, and 
the correct answer was coming out. After beating my head against the wall trying to figure out where my programming error was, I 
took another look at the input I entered. I had entered three crates incorrectly. Oops. 

After I corrected the crate inputs, it worked. 

I may go back on this later to try to parse the entire input file rather than split it and manually enter the starting stacks. 
Manual entry was what bit me on this day.
